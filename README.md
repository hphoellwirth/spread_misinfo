## Abstract
This project simulates the spread of (mis)information and obstacles to wisdom of crowds in social learning for a particular syntactic network. 
I consider a variant of different models which are based on a belief update model proposed and studied by Acemoglu, Ozdaglar, and ParandehGheibi (2010). 
In particular, I test the speed of convergence and its related consensus value in the presence of misinformation, both with and without forceful agents. 
I also simulate the effect of multiple stubborn agents with different beliefs. 
Finally, I propose a novel extension to the model and show the impact this extension has on the convergence and consensus value of the tested network. 

## Literature
The simulations are largly based on a social learning model proposed by D. Acemoglu, A. Ozdaglar, and A. ParandehGheibi. Spread of (mis)information in social networks. Games and Economic Behavior, 70:194–227, 2010.
